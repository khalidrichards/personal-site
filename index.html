                <h3>Etherverse Card Game</h3>
                <div class="project-details">
                    <p>I've been an avid gamer since childhood. I especially have a love of tabletop games, which I find blend
                        social and competitive dynamics pretty well. Card games hold a special place in my heart. I was a huge fan of
                        Yu-Gi-Oh! as a child and am a big Magic: the Gathering fan now. This experience with card games led me to design
                        my own. Etherverse is a tactical card game that blends some of the charm of Magic: the Gathering with a bit of
                        the spatial strategy of minis. I'm currently accepting folks to help playtest the game and give feedback!

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p>Mathematics is a longtime love of mine. I've been away from it too long, and I've decided to go back to basics,
                        reteach myself some basics (calculus, linear algebra, etc.), and then explore more complex topics. I'm currently
                        re-learning probability, following Sheldon Ross's <i>A First Course in Probability</i>.

            I'm always receptive to conversations around new professional opportunities. Currently, I'm looking for
            <b>senior software engineering opportunities</b> (preferably backend focused). I personally prefer remote work but I am open to hybrid in NYC.
